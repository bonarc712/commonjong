# commonjong
An open-source mahjong engine in Java.

## What are the goals of commonjong?
The idea with commonjong is to drive the backend of a game of mahjong entirely. The following points are included in the scope.

### Game Engine
With Commonjong, the following will be possible.
* Have a running game structure.
* Make calls for a win, a triplet, a quad, or a run.
* A hand can be recognized as ready or X from ready.
* A hand can be scored as though it was played normally.

### Rules
The MVP of Commonjong is introducing `Riichi` rules first, as these are the rules the coders are most familiar with, but we thrive to be able to have a structure that allows to make your own rules.
* Riichi rules and winning conditions will come out of the box and cover WRC, Tenhou, Mahjong Soul and Montr√©al rules.
* A framework will be implemented to allow for tweaks to rules.
* We plan to eventually add other variants (eg. MCR, American, SBR). 

### API
* The idea is to have a common API that will be usable by any outside application to drive mahjong games effectively and quickly.

### Out of scope
* Network connectivity
* UI
* Social interactions between players
